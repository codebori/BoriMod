MM configs for RF ISRU etc including new resource Crude Oil

Oil is only found on Kerbin and maybe Laythe

Processes (numbers are mostly guesswork):

1. Drilling/Pumping:

- Ore (Stock)
- Crude Oil 90% + Natural Gas (primarly Methane) 10% (DumpExcess = true)
- Water
- ? more to be added

2. Refining (ISRU):

- Kerosine:
  Input: Oil
  Output: 15% Kerosine + 1% LqdMethane (DumpExcess = true)
  
- Hydrogen from Methane:
  Input: Methane
  Output: 75% Hydrogen + CO2 (DumpExcess = true)
  
- Hydrogen from Water 

- (Lqd)Methane:
  Input: Oil + CO2?
  Output: (Lqd)Methane +?
  
- Hydrogen:
  Input: Oil
  Output: Hydrogen + Methane
 
- ? more to be added
