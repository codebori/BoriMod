# BoriMod

MM configs for:

- ISRU plus including new resource Crude Oil

Oil is only found on Kerbin and maybe Laythe

Processes (numbers are mostly guesswork):

1. Drilling/Pumping:

  - Ore (Stock)
  - Crude Oil 90% + Natural Gas (primarly Methane) 10% (DumpExcess = true)
  - Water
  - ? more to be added

2. Refining (ISRU):

  - Kerosine:
    Input: Oil
    Output: 15% Kerosine + 1% LqdMethane (DumpExcess = true)
  
  - Hydrogen from Methane:
    Input: Methane
    Output: 75% Hydrogen + CO2 (DumpExcess = true)
  
  - Hydrogen from Water 

  - (Lqd)Methane:
    Input: Oil + CO2?
    Output: (Lqd)Methane +?
  
  - Hydrogen:
    Input: Oil
    Output: Hydrogen + Methane
 
  - ? more to be added 

- Remove Liquid Fuel etc from ISRU

- Replace Rocketparts with Materialkits

TO DO

1. Test

2. Figure out the correct order and mod dependencies and remove ":FINAL"
